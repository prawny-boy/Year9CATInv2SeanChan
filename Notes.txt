SUMMARY:
the point of the investigation is to approximate the value of intergration
intergration but simpler and stuff about calculus

1 Guessing the area under a function (integral of a function) by using random selection
KEY TERMS:
Function: 
    a function of a thing on a graph 
    e.g. line function y=x^2+1
Integral of a function (or integral): 
    area under graph of a function
OVERVIEW:
You can calculate (using very hard math) the integral of a function
practically means can calculate area under a function 
    for example a line
    or a curve or parabola etc.

This is just given to us to show us what is possible - we dont need to do This
instead we are approximating this area through a method called random selection

1.1 Approximating Intergration of a function
this section in the document: 
    starts to describe what method we will use to calculate integral
    explains it in detail

so lets say we have a graph that goes to 20 for both x and y
and we need to find the area under a line that goes from 0, 10 to 20, 10
    1. generate alot of random dots in the graph
    2. count the number of dots above the line
    3. count the number of dots below the line
    4. get the total area of the graph (20*20 = 400)
    5. use the ratio of above:below to find area below the line

the method is called the monte carlo estimate

1.1.2 Problem 2
now we need to use the monte carlo estimate
to find the area under this equation on a 3x9 graph:
     y = x^2
and generate a image of the graphed function and sampling like the example in 1.1
equation: y = x^2 for 0‚â§ x ‚â§ 3.

1.1.3 Problem 3
same thing but on a 4x3 graph with a line and a curve
so you need to find the area enclosed by the line and the curve
literally the same thing
equation: ùë¶=1/2x+1 and ùë¶=(ùë•‚àí2)^2+0.5 for 0‚â§ùë•‚â§4.

1.2 literally the same as 1.1 but with pixels
this is too easy
so like theres a short tutorial but what you need to do is answer some questions
and go into a file they gave us called pixel_tutorial.py

2.1 Same thing as 1.1 but PIXELS (now you can start doing the real stuff)
so like make sure you do 1.2 it helps alot

2.1.1 the TEST for the tutorial on pixels
literally they gave you a lightning bolt image and you just find the area of the bolt using random sampling
and pixel things they teach you in 1.2

3.1 MORE TESTS (on images and pixels same as 2.1.1)
Pull up the image that they gave you 3.1.png

3.1.1 calculate area of board to target (YAY NO CODING)
so the board is a 1x1 square
and the target is a circle whose edges touch the edges of the square
calculate the ratio of target:board area
no need code just math

3.1.2 random sampling the board problem
so this is just like 3.1.1 but instead of math you do it with random sampling
youre getting the hang of this just do random sampling for everything

3.1.3 probability of scoring 10 or MORE
so now its more complicated math so you can calculate the probabilty of scoring 10 or more
there are numbers on the rings how much you score
If the inner red circle has a radius of r1, and each circle on the board is larger than the 
immediately smaller circle by 2 r1.  Work out the exact likelihood that a person will score 10 
or more.

3.1.4 random sampling the 10 or more problem
same thing as 3.1.2 but with 3.1.3

3.1.5 a slightly misaligned target
pull up the image they gave you 3.3.png
just use random sampling to calculate area of each rings
