SUMMARY:
the point of the investigation is to approximate the value of intergration
intergration but simpler and stuff about calculus

1 Guessing the area under a function (integral of a function) by using random selection
KEY TERMS:
Function: 
    a function of a thing on a graph 
    e.g. line function y=x^2+1
Integral of a function (or integral): 
    area under graph of a function
OVERVIEW:
You can calculate (using very hard math) the integral of a function
practically means can calculate area under a function 
    for example a line
    or a curve or parabola etc.

This is just given to us to show us what is possible - we dont need to do This
instead we are approximating this area through a method called random selection

1.1 Approximating Intergration of a function
this section in the document: 
    starts to describe what method we will use to calculate integral
    explains it in detail

so lets say we have a graph that goes to 20 for both x and y
and we need to find the area under a line that goes from 0, 10 to 20, 10
    1. generate alot of random dots in the graph
    2. count the number of dots above the line
    3. count the number of dots below the line
    4. get the total area of the graph (20*20 = 400)
    5. use the ratio of above:below to find area below the line

the method is called the monte carlo estimate

1.1.2 Problem 2
now we need to use the monte carlo estimate
to find the area under this equation on a 3x9 graph:
     y = x^2
and generate a image of the graphed function and sampling like the example in 1.1
equation: y = x^2 for 0‚â§ x ‚â§ 3.

1.1.3 Problem 3
same thing but on a 4x3 graph with a line and a curve
so you need to find the area enclosed by the line and the curve
literally the same thing
equation: ùë¶=1/2x+1 and ùë¶=(ùë•‚àí2)^2 for 0‚â§ùë•‚â§4.

1.2 literally the same as 1.1 but with pixels
this is too easy
